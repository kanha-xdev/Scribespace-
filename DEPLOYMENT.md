## 🔗 Integration Points

When your backend team is ready, they need to replace the mock API calls in:
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - Remove mock data, use real API
- `client/src/lib/mockData.ts` - Can be deleted when backend is ready

## 📝 What to Tell Your Team

- Professional UI components (Navbar, BlogCard, Forms)

- Ready for backend API integration

**🔲 What the team needs to do:**
