   - Output Directory: `dist` ✅
   - Install Command: `npm install` ✅

### Method 2: Manual CLI Deploy

```bash
cd client/
npm install
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to Vercel or use Vercel CLI
```

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### Build Issues Resolved:

### TypeScript Errors Fixed:
- ❌ **Before**: 26 TypeScript errors
